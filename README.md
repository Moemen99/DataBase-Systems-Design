# Entity Types in ERDs: Strong and Weak Entities

In Entity Relationship Diagrams (ERDs), entities can be classified into two main types: strong entities and weak entities. Understanding the difference between these types is crucial for effective database design.

## Strong Entities

### Definition
A strong entity is an entity whose existence does not depend on the existence of any other entity in the system.

### Characteristics
- Can be uniquely identified by its own attributes
- Exists independently of other entities

### Visual Representation
- Single rectangle in ERD

### Example
A "Customer" entity in a retail database system

## Weak Entities

### Definition
A weak entity is an entity whose existence depends on the existence of another entity (called the owner or parent entity) in the system.

### Characteristics
- Cannot be uniquely identified by its own attributes alone
- Requires the attributes of its owner entity for unique identification
- Its existence is contingent on the existence of the owner entity

### Visual Representation
- Double rectangle in ERD

### Example
An "Order Line Item" entity that depends on the existence of an "Order" entity

## Relationship Between Strong and Weak Entities

### Identifying Relationship
The relationship between a weak entity and its owner (strong) entity is called an identifying relationship.

### Visual Representation
- Double diamond in ERD

## Visual Representation

```mermaid
erDiagram
    CUSTOMER ||--o{ ORDER : places
    CUSTOMER {
        int customerID
        string name
    }
    ORDER ||--|{ ORDER_ITEM : contains
    ORDER {
        int orderID
        date orderDate
    }
    ORDER_ITEM {
        int lineItemNumber
        int quantity
    }
```

In this diagram:
- CUSTOMER and ORDER are strong entities (single rectangle)
- ORDER_ITEM is a weak entity (double rectangle in standard notation, shown here as a regular entity due to mermaid limitations)
- The relationship between ORDER and ORDER_ITEM would typically be shown with a double diamond (shown here as a single line due to mermaid limitations)

## Key Points

1. Strong entities exist independently in the system.
2. Weak entities depend on strong entities for their existence.
3. The relationship between a weak entity and its parent strong entity is an identifying relationship.
4. In ERDs, strong entities are represented by single rectangles, weak entities by double rectangles, and identifying relationships by double diamonds.

## Importance in Database Design

- Understanding entity types helps in properly structuring the database.
- It ensures that dependencies between data are correctly modeled.
- Helps in maintaining data integrity and enforcing proper constraints in the database system.

*Note: The visual representation in actual ERD tools may differ slightly from the mermaid diagram shown here, particularly in the representation of weak entities and identifying relationships.*
